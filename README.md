# OSC Fader Wing

OSC Fader Wing, built on the Arduino Mega platform for Technical Theatre Society. 

Uses Motorised Faders from the Behringer X32, and OSC to communicate with the EOS Desk. 

It's a work in progress, with only faders, motorised faders & lcd implemented - hopefully as a project someone can finish off in the future
